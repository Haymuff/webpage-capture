> Fastly capture the web using headless browser with many options

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/webpage-capture.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/webpage-capture/)

This program is an overlay of [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) which is designed to allow the easy extraction of single or multiple pages or sections, in multiple formats and in the fastest way possible.


## Installation as module

If you want to use it inside your scripts, save and install it in your project dependencies.

```
npm install --save webpage-capture
```

Once it has done you can import **webpage-capture** in your scripts and start using it, refer to the [usage](#usage) section.

## Installation as CLI

You can also use it as a cli-tool installing it as a global module:

```
npm install -g webpage-capture
```

Than you can start playing around with the options using the built-in help typing: `-h, --help`

---

## Usage

First you have to import __webpage-capture__ and initializire a new capturer with default or custom options.

```js
import WebCapture from 'webpage-capture'
const capturer = new WebCapture()

(async () => {
  const res = await capturer.capture('https://github.com/b4dnewz/webpage-capture')
  console.log(res);
})().catch(console.log)
    .then(capturer.close())
```

Don't forget to __close__ the capturer once you have done, otherwise the headless browser instance will not disconnect correctly.

The capture method can handle __strings__ and __array of strings__, for example:

```js
await capturer.capture([
  'https://github.com/b4dnewz',
  'https://github.com/b4dnewz/webpage-capture'
])
```
