> Capture the web in many ways using headless chrome

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url] [![Coverage percentage][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

This program is an overlay of [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) which is designed to allow the easy extraction of single or multiple pages or sections, in multiple formats and in the fastest way possible.


## Installation as module

If you want to use it inside your scripts, save and install it in your project dependencies.

```
npm install --save webpage-capture
```

Once it has done you can import **webpage-capture** in your scripts and start using it, refer to the [usage](#usage) section.

## Installation as CLI

You can also use it from the command line using the [cli module](), installing it globally:

```
npm install -g webpage-capture-cli
```

Than you can start playing around with the options using the built-in help typing: `-h, --help`

---

## Usage

First you have to import __webpage-capture__ and initializire a new capturer with default or custom options.

```js
import WebCapture from 'webpage-capture'
const capturer = new WebCapture()

(async () => {

  // Single input
  await capturer.capture('https://google.it')

  // Multiple inputs
  const res = await capturer.capture([
    'https://github.com/b4dnewz',
    'https://github.com/b4dnewz/webpage-capture'
  ])
  console.log(res);

})().catch(console.log)
    .then(capturer.close())
```

Don't forget to __close__ the capturer once you have done, otherwise the headless browser instance will not disconnect correctly.

### Instance Options

The constructor can also take options to set default values for all the subsequent captures:

```js
const capturer = new WebCapture({
  // default options
})
```

#### outputDir

Type: `String`  
Default value: `process.cwd()`

Specify a custom directory where place the captured files.

#### timeout

Type: `Number`  
Default value: `30000`

Specify the default page timeout to load a page (in ms).

#### headers

Type: `Object`  

Set the headers to be used during all the requests.

#### viewport

Type: `String, Object`  

Set the default viewport that is used when not specified.

#### debug

Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`

Run the script in __headfull__ mode with a delay of 1 second so you can see what is doing.

#### launchArgs

Type: `Array`  
Default value: `[]`

Custom launch arguments to be passed to Chromium instance, if you are a linux user
and you are experiencing some issues, you may want to [disable sandbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#setting-up-chrome-linux-sandbox) or setup differently.


The capture method can handle __strings__ and __array of strings__, for example:

```js
await capturer.capture([
  'https://github.com/b4dnewz',
  'https://github.com/b4dnewz/webpage-capture'
])
```

Returns a `Promise<Buffer>` with the screenshot as binary.

### base64(input, [options])

Capture a screnshot of the given `input`.

Returns a `Promise<string>` with the screenshot as [Base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/Base64_encoding_and_decoding).

### capture(inputs, [options])
